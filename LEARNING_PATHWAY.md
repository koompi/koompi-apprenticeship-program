## Learning Cycle

Each module follows this pattern:

1. **Read** — Read the lesson content
2. **Try** — Type out all code examples
3. **Experiment** — Modify examples, break things
4. **Build** — Complete the exercises
5. **Reflect** — Write what you learned
6. **Teach** — Explain it to someone else

---

## When to Move On

You're ready for the next module when you can:

- Explain the concepts in your own words (in Khmer or English)
- Write the code without looking at examples
- Complete the exercises successfully
- Help another apprentice who is stuck on this topic

**Remember**: Speed is not the goal. Understanding is.

## Tips for Success

1. **Code every day** — Even 30 minutes is better than nothing
2. **Type, don't copy-paste** — Your fingers need to remember
3. **Make mistakes** — They are your best teachers
4. **Ask questions** — There are no stupid questions
5. **Teach others** — You learn twice when you teach
6. **Build things** — Projects are better than tutorials
7. **Be patient** — This is a marathon, not a sprint
8. **Celebrate wins** — Every module completed is an achievement
