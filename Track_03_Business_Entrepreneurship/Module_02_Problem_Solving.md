### The 15-Minute Rule

Before asking for help:

1. Try to solve it yourself for 15 minutes
2. Document what you've tried
3. Then ask for help with context

This builds your problem-solving skills while respecting others' time.

### Defining Problems Clearly

| Unclear Problem | Clear Problem |
|-----------------|---------------|
| "It doesn't work" | "The submit button doesn't respond when clicked on Chrome mobile" |
| "The website looks bad" | "The header overlaps with content on screens under 768px" |
| "The code has a bug" | "The function returns undefined instead of the user's name" |

## Lesson 3: Research Skills

### How to Research Effectively

```
1. IDENTIFY what you need to know
   → "How do I center a div horizontally?"

2. CHOOSE the right sources
   → MDN, Stack Overflow, Official Docs

3. EVALUATE the information
   → Is it current? Is it reliable?

4. APPLY what you learned
   → Try the solution

5. DOCUMENT for future reference
   → Save useful resources
```

### Quality Sources

| Source | Best For | Trust Level |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Official Documentation | Accurate syntax, API | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| MDN Web Docs | HTML/CSS/JS reference | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Stack Overflow | Common problems | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (check votes) |
| Dev.to / Medium | Tutorials, explanations | ⭐⭐⭐ (varies) |
| Random blogs | Various | ⭐⭐ (verify) |
| YouTube | Visual learning | ⭐⭐⭐ (check date) |

### Evaluating Information

Ask these questions:

- **When** was this written? (Outdated?)
- **Who** wrote it? (Expert? Company?)
- **How many** people found it helpful? (Votes, comments)
- **Does it work** when I try it?

### The Rubber Duck Method

Explain your problem out loud (even to a rubber duck):

- What are you trying to do?
- What's happening instead?
- What have you tried?

Often, you'll find the answer while explaining!

---

## Lesson 5: Critical Thinking

### Question Everything

Don't just accept information — evaluate it:

| Passive Learner | Critical Thinker |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "This tutorial says so" | "Why does this work?" |
| "Everyone uses this" | "Is this the best approach?" |
| "It worked once" | "Will this work in all cases?" |

### Ask "Why" Five Times

To find the root cause of a problem:

```
Problem: The website is slow

Why? → The images take long to load
Why? → The images are very large files
Why? → They weren't optimized
Why? → We didn't have a process for it
Why? → We didn't know we should

ROOT CAUSE: Knowledge gap about optimization
SOLUTION: Learn and implement image optimization
```

### Consider Multiple Perspectives

When solving problems, consider:

- The **user's** perspective
- The **business's** perspective
- The **technical** perspective
- The **long-term** perspective

### When Stuck

1. **Take a break** — Walk away for 10 minutes
2. **Sleep on it** — Your brain works while you sleep
3. **Try a different approach** — There are many solutions
4. **Ask for hints** — Not answers, just direction

### Build Your Knowledge Base

Keep track of what you learn:

- Bookmarks for useful sites
- Notes on solutions
- Code snippets library
- Lessons from mistakes

## Lesson 7: Asking Smart Questions

### Before You Ask

- [ ] Have I tried to solve it myself?
- [ ] Have I searched for solutions?
- [ ] Can I clearly explain the problem?
- [ ] Can I show what I've tried?

### How to Ask

Bad question:

```
"It doesn't work. Help!"
```

Good question:

```
"I'm trying to center a div horizontally. I've tried margin: auto 
and text-align: center, but it's still aligned left. Here's my code
[code snippet]. I'm using Chrome on Windows. What am I missing?"
```

### The XY Problem

Sometimes you ask about your attempted solution (Y) instead of the actual problem (X).

```
Bad: "How do I get the last 3 characters of a filename?"
(You want to check file extension, but asking about substring)

Better: "How do I check if a file is a PDF?"
(Now everyone can suggest the best approach)
```

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Define Problems

Rewrite these vague problems clearly:

1. "The website looks wrong"
2. "My code doesn't work"
3. "The button is broken"

### Exercise 2: Research Practice

Research and solve:

1. "How to add a shadow to a box in CSS"
2. "How to validate an email input in HTML"
3. "How to make a sticky header"

Document which sources you used and why.

### Exercise 3: Debug This

Find the bug:

```html
<button onclick="submit()>Submit</button>
```

### Exercise 4: Root Cause Analysis

Use "5 Whys" on this problem:
"Users are complaining our website is hard to use"

### Exercise 5: Smart Question

Write a good question for asking help with a coding problem you've faced recently.
