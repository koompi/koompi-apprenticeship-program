## Lesson 1: What is Entrepreneurship?

### More Than Starting a Company

- ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS...
- NOT JUST ACTUALLY
- Starting companies Seeing opportunities
- Getting rich Creating value
- Taking big risks Solving problems
- Working alone Building things that matter
- Only for businesspeople For anyone who wants impact
- An ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSET can be applied:
- • As an employee (intrapreneurship)
- • In your own projects
- • When solving any problem
- • Throughout your career

### The Entrepreneur's Question

Always ask: **"How can I create more value?"**

---

## Lesson 2: The Value Equation

### What is Value?

Value is solving problems or fulfilling needs for others.

```
VALUE = Solving a problem someone has
 = Doing something better, faster, cheaper
 = Making someone's life easier
 = Creating something people want
```

### Example: KOOMPI's Value

```
PROBLEM:
- Expensive laptops
- Software costs money
- Not designed for Cambodia's needs

KOOMPI'S VALUE:
- Affordable hardware
- Free open-source software
- Designed for Cambodian users
- Support in local context
```

### Your Value as a Developer

What value can YOU create?

| Skill | Value Created |
|-------|---------------|
| Build websites | Businesses can reach customers |
| Fix bugs | Users have better experience |
| Write documentation | Others learn faster |
| Solve problems | Team moves faster |
| Learn new technology | Bring new capabilities |

---

## Lesson 3: Opportunity Recognition

### Where Opportunities Hide

Opportunities often appear as:

- **Frustrations** — "I wish this was easier"
- **Gaps** — "Why doesn't this exist?"
- **Inefficiencies** — "This takes too long"
- **Changes** — New technology, trends, needs

### Training Your Eyes

Ask yourself:

1. What annoys people?
2. What takes too long?
3. What costs too much?
4. What's confusing?
5. What's missing?

### Example: Finding Opportunities

```
Observation: "Many Cambodian businesses have no website"

Opportunity Questions:
• Why don't they have websites?
 → They think it's expensive
 → They don't know how
 → They don't see the value

• How could this be solved?
 → Affordable website packages
 → Simple website templates
 → Education about benefits
 → Khmer-language platforms

Each answer is a potential opportunity!
```

## Lesson 4: Basic Business Concepts

### Revenue and Profit

```
REVENUE = Money coming in (sales)
EXPENSES = Money going out (costs)
PROFIT = Revenue - Expenses

Example:
Sell 10 websites at $200 each = $2,000 revenue
Hosting costs, time, etc. = $500 expenses
Profit = $1,500
```

### Business Models

How do businesses make money?

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Product | Sell a thing | KOOMPI sells laptops |
| Service | Do work for clients | Web design agency |
| Subscription | Regular payments | Netflix, Spotify |
| Freemium | Free + paid features | Dropbox, Zoom |
| Advertising | Show ads | Google, Facebook |
| Marketplace | Connect buyers/sellers | Grab, Amazon |

### Customers and Markets

- **Customer**: Who pays for your product/service
- **User**: Who uses your product (sometimes different!)
- **Market**: Group of potential customers
- **Target Market**: Specific group you focus on

---

## Lesson 5: Thinking in Solutions

### Idea → Solution → Product

```
IDEA
"Make a website for restaurants"
 ↓
SOLUTION (with detail)
"An easy-to-update menu page for small Cambodian restaurants"
 ↓
PRODUCT (with features)
- Simple admin panel
- Menu with photos
- Khmer language
- Mobile-friendly
- Affordable hosting
```

### Start Small: MVP

**MVP** = Minimum Viable Product

Build the simplest version that solves the core problem:

```
IDEA: E-commerce platform for Cambodia

FULL VISION:
• Multiple sellers
• Payment gateway
• Delivery tracking
• Reviews and ratings
• Chat features
• Mobile app

MVP VERSION:
• One seller
• Simple product list
• Contact for ordering
• Facebook integration

Start with MVP → Learn → Improve
```

### Validation: Test Before You Build

Before building, check:

1. Do people actually have this problem?
2. Would they pay for a solution?
3. Is your solution better than alternatives?

How to validate:

- Talk to potential users
- Show a prototype
- Build a landing page
- Get pre-orders or commitments
