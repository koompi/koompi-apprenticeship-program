## Core Values

### 1. Customer-First Thinking

Every decision should consider: "How does this help our customers?"

### 2. Value Creation

Don't just complete tasks. Create **value**. Ask:

- Does this solve a real problem?
- Who benefits from this work?
- How can I do this better?

### 3. Ownership

Take ownership of your work:

- If you see a problem, solve it
- If you make a mistake, own it and fix it
- If you need help, ask for it

### 4. Continuous Improvement

Never stop learning:

- Seek feedback actively
- Learn from failures
- Improve constantly

## Real-World Learning

- **Customer interactions** — Real conversations
