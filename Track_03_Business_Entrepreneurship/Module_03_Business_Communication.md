## Lesson 4: Giving & Receiving Feedback

### Giving Feedback

Use the **SBI Model**:

I - IMPACT How did it affect you/others/work?
```

**Example:**

```
"During yesterday's demo (S), when you explained the 
navigation features (B), it really helped the customer 
understand the product better (I). Great job!"
```

**For constructive feedback:**

```
"In this morning's meeting (S), when you interrupted 
Dara before she finished (B), it seemed to discourage 
her from sharing further ideas (I). Maybe try waiting 
a moment to make sure everyone's done speaking?"
```

### Receiving Feedback

**Do:**

- Listen fully before responding
- Ask questions to understand
- Thank them for the feedback
- Reflect on it honestly
- Take action to improve

**Don't:**

- Get defensive
