# 🏆 Assessment & Certification Guide

## KOOMPI Apprenticeship Program

---

## 📋 Overview

The KOOMPI Apprenticeship Program uses a **competency-based assessment system**. This means:

- ✅ You advance when you **demonstrate mastery**, not after a fixed time
- ✅ Assessment is **continuous**, not just exams
- ✅ **Projects and real work** count more than tests
- ✅ **Teaching others** is the highest form of proof

## 🎖️ Badge System

Every module awards badges based on demonstrated competency:

### Three Badge Levels Per Module

## 🔍 Assessment Methods

### 1. Self-Check Exercises (Every Lesson)

At the end of each lesson, apprentices complete exercises to verify understanding.

**Format:**

- Coding challenges
- "Can you explain?" questions
- "Build this" mini-tasks

**Example:**

```
Self-Check: HTML Lists
═══════════════════════

1. Create an unordered list of your 3 favorite foods
2. Create an ordered list of steps to make rice
3. Explain: What is the difference between <ul> and <ol>?
4. Challenge: Create a nested list (a list inside a list)
```

### 2. Module Projects (Every Module)

Each module ends with a practical project that combines all skills learned.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criteria | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Functionality (Does it work?) | 40% |
| Code Quality (Is it clean?) | 25% |
| Creativity (Did they go beyond?) | 15% |
| Documentation (Can others understand?) | 20% |

### 3. Mentor Verification (Weekly)

Mentors conduct brief check-ins to verify progress:

**Quick Verification Questions (5-10 minutes):**

- Show me your code from this week
- Explain how this part works
- What did you find difficult?
- What will you work on next?

### 4. Peer Teaching (Ongoing)

Apprentices earn Master Badges by teaching others:

**Teaching Assessment:**

- Did the learner understand?
- Was the explanation clear?
- Did the teacher show patience?
- Did both learn something?

### 5. Real Work Performance (Ongoing)

How apprentices perform in real KOOMPI work:

**Observed Behaviors:**

- Customer interaction quality
- Problem-solving approach
- Teamwork and communication
- Initiative and responsibility

## 🎯 Assessment Best Practices

### For Mentors

1. **Be encouraging** — Focus on growth, not gaps
2. **Be specific** — "Your loop logic was correct" > "Good job"
3. **Ask questions** — Help them discover answers, don't just tell
4. **Celebrate progress** — Every step forward matters
5. **Document everything** — Keep records of achievements

### For Apprentices

1. **Be honest** — Don't pretend to understand when you don't
2. **Show your work** — Let mentors see your code, even if messy
3. **Ask for feedback** — Seek guidance, not just approval
4. **Track yourself** — Keep your progress log updated
5. **Help others** — Teaching is the best assessment
