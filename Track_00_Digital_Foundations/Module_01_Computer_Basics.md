## Lesson 1: What is a Computer?

### Understanding Your Machine

A **computer** is an electronic device that processes information. Think of it as a very fast, very obedient helper that follows your instructions exactly.

### The Main Parts of a Computer

- COMPUTER COMPONENTS
- HARDWARE (Physical parts you can touch)
- SCREEN (Monitor/Display)
- • Shows you information
- • Output device
- KEYBOARD
- • You type letters and numbers
- • Input device
- MOUSE / TOUCHPAD
- • You point and click
- • Input device
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- • The "brain" - does all the thinking
- • Inside the computer
- RAM (Random Access Memory)
- • Short-term memory
- • Holds what you're working on now
- • Clears when power off
- STORAGE (Hard Drive / SSD)
- • Long-term memory
- • Keeps your files forever
- • Stays when power off

### Software vs Hardware

| Type | What is it? | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Hardware** | Physical parts you can touch | Screen, keyboard, mouse |
| **Software** | Programs and apps (instructions) | KOOMPI OS, Firefox, VS Code |

**Analogy**: Hardware is like your body. Software is like your thoughts and skills.

## Lesson 2: Introduction to KOOMPI OS

### What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is the main software that controls your computer. It:

- Manages all the hardware
- Runs other programs
- Provides a way for you to interact with the computer

### KOOMPI OS is Linux-Based

**Linux** is a family of operating systems that is:

- 🆓 **Free** — No cost to use
- **Open Source** — Anyone can see and improve the code
- **Secure** — Very safe from viruses
- **Powerful** — Used by professional developers worldwide

**Fun Fact**: Most of the internet runs on Linux! Google, Facebook, and most servers use Linux.

### Why KOOMPI Uses Linux

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost | Free, no license fees |
| Learning | Teaches real skills used in tech industry |
| Control | You learn how the computer really works |
| Community | Millions of developers share knowledge |
