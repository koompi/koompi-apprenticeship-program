## Lesson 1: Overcoming Speaking Fear

### Common Fears

Every learner has these fears. They are normal!

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ COMMON SPEAKING FEARS │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ │
│ "What if I make mistakes?" │
│ → EVERYONE makes mistakes. Even native speakers. │
│ → Mistakes help you learn. │
│ │
│ "What if people don't understand me?" │
│ → Speak slowly. It's better than speaking fast and unclear. │
│ → Ask "Did that make sense?" │
│ │
│ "What if I forget words?" │
│ → Describe the word: "the thing that you use to..." │
│ → Ask: "How do you say...?" - It's okay! │
│ │
│ "My accent isn't good enough" │
│ → Your accent is fine. Clarity matters more than accent. │
│ → Many successful tech people have accents. │
│ │
│ REMEMBER: The goal is communication, not perfection! │
│ │

### Building Confidence

1. **Practice daily** — Speaking improves with practice
2. **Start small** — Begin with one-on-one conversations
3. **Prepare** — Know what you'll say beforehand
4. **Slow down** — Speaking slower sounds more confident
5. **Accept mistakes** — They're part of learning

## Lesson 2: Daily Conversation Phrases

### Meeting Basics

- "I'm not sure I understand. Could you explain?"
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you give an example?"

## Lesson 3: Explaining Technical Concepts

### The "ELI5" Method

**ELI5** = Explain Like I'm 5

Break complex topics into simple language.

**Technical explanation:**

```
"The function uses recursion to traverse the DOM tree and 
modifies the style properties of each element."
```

**ELI5 explanation:**

```
"This code goes through every element on the page, 
one by one, and changes how they look."
```

### Structure for Explanations

```
1. WHAT it is (simple definition)
2. WHY it's used (purpose)
3. HOW it works (basic mechanism)
4. EXAMPLE (concrete illustration)
```

**Example: Explaining Flexbox**

```
WHAT: "Flexbox is a way to arrange items in CSS."

WHY: "We use it to easily align and space things on a page."

HOW: "You put display: flex on the parent, and the children 
automatically line up in a row."

EXAMPLE: "For instance, a navigation bar with links side by side 
uses flexbox. The nav is the parent, the links are children."
```

## Lesson 6: Pronunciation Tips

### Common Tech Words
