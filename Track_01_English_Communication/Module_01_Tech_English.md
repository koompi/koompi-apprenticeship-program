---

## Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Read and understand technical documentation
- Interpret error messages accurately

## Lesson 1: Why Tech English Matters

### The Language of Programming

Programming itself is in English:

- Keywords: `if`, `else`, `function`, `return`
- Element names: `div`, `paragraph`, `button`
- Properties: `background-color`, `margin`, `padding`

All documentation is primarily in English:

- MDN Web Docs
- Stack Overflow
- GitHub
- Official tutorials

### Your Advantage

Learning English while coding gives you:

- Access to 95% of programming resources
- Better job opportunities
- Global community connection
- Faster problem solving

| Deploy | Put website online | ដាក់ឡើងបណ្តាញ |
| Debug | Find and fix errors | រកកំហុស |

### HTML/CSS Terms

| English | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Element | HTML component | `<p>`, `<div>` |
| Tag | Markers defining elements | `<h1>`, `</h1>` |
| Attribute | Extra information | `class="header"` |
| Property | CSS setting | `color`, `margin` |
| Value | What to set it to | `blue`, `20px` |

| Responsive | Works on all devices | Mobile-friendly |

### Programming Action Words

| Verb | Meaning | Example Sentence |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Create | Make new | "Create a new file" |
| Delete | Remove | "Delete the old code" |

## Lesson 3: Reading Documentation

### Understanding Doc Structure

- TYPICAL DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE
- TITLE The name of what you're learning
- DESCRIPTION What it does (brief explanation)
- SYNTAX How to write it (code format)
- PARAMETERS Options you can provide
- RETURN VALUE What you get back
- EXAMPLES Working code samples
- SEE ALSO Related topics

### Example: Reading MDN

When you see documentation like this:

```
Array.prototype.push()

The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array 
and returns the new length of the array.

Syntax:
push(element0, element1, /* … ,*/ elementN)

Parameters:
elementN - The element(s) to add to the end of the array.

Return value:
The new length property of the object upon which the method was called.
- **Break it down:**
- 1. **What**: `push()` adds elements to array
- 2. **How**: `array.push(item)`
- 3. **Result**: Returns new array length

- ## Lesson 4: Understanding Error Messages
- ### Common Error Patterns
- Errors follow patterns. Learn to read them:
- ```javascript
- TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined
- The variable is undefined
- Looking for 'name'
- Cannot read a property
- Type of error

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | How to Fix |
|-------|---------|------------|
| "undefined is not a function" | Calling something that isn't a function | Check function name spelling |
| "Cannot read property of undefined" | Variable doesn't exist | Make sure variable is defined |
| "Unexpected token" | Syntax error | Check for missing comma, bracket |
| "404 Not Found" | File/page doesn't exist | Check file path |
| "500 Internal Server Error" | Server-side problem | Check server logs |

### Error Reading Strategy

1. **Read the whole message** — don't panic
2. **Find the file name** — where is the error?
3. **Find the line number** — which line?
4. **Identify the error type** — what kind?
5. **Read the description** — what happened?
6. **Search online** — paste the error in Google

---

## Lesson 5: Searching for Solutions

### How to Search Effectively

- EFFECTIVE SEARCH STRATEGY
- STRUCTURE: [technology] [what you want to do]
- EXAMPLES:
- GOOD SEARCHES
- • "css center div horizontally"
- • "javascript loop through array"
- • "html form submit button"
- • "react useState example"
- BAD SEARCHES
- • "why doesn't my code work"
- • "help with my project"
- • "how to make a website"
- TIPS:
- • Include the technology (CSS, JavaScript, React)
- • Use specific keywords
- • Add "example" for code samples
- • Add "tutorial" for step-by-step

### Reading Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a question & answer site for programmers.

**Structure:**

- **Question**: Someone's problem
- **Answers**: Solutions (sorted by votes)
- **Green checkmark**: Accepted answer
- **Vote count**: How helpful (higher = better)
- **Comments**: Additional info

**Strategy:**

1. Read the question — is it your problem?
2. Check the accepted answer first
3. Read top-voted answers
4. Check the date — old answers might be outdated

## Lesson 6: Building Vocabulary Daily

### Keep a Tech Vocabulary Journal

Create `vocabulary.md`:

```markdown
# My Tech Vocabulary

## Week 1

### Monday
- **Deploy**: Put a website online for people to see
 - Example: "I deployed my website to Vercel"
 
- **Repository (repo)**: Storage for project files on GitHub
 - Example: "Clone the repository to your computer"

### Tuesday
- **Render**: Display something on screen
 - Example: "The browser renders HTML as a webpage"
```

### Learning New Words

When you encounter a new word:

1. **Write it down** in your vocabulary journal
2. **Find the definition** (Google: "define [word]" or "[word] meaning in programming")
3. **Write an example sentence**
4. **Use it** in conversation or daily log

### Words to Learn Each Day

**Goal**: 3-5 new tech words per day

**Sources**:

- Error messages you encounter
- Documentation you read
- Tutorials you follow
- Conversations with mentors

## Key Phrases for Developers

### Asking for Help

```
"I'm trying to [do something] but [problem]. I've tried [solutions]."

Example:
"I'm trying to center a div but it's staying on the left. 
I've tried using margin: auto but it's not working."
```

### Describing Problems

```
"When I [action], [result] instead of [expected]."

Example:
"When I click the button, nothing happens instead of submitting the form."
```

### Searching Online

```
"[technology] how to [action]"
"[technology] [error] fix"
"[technology] [thing] example"
```
