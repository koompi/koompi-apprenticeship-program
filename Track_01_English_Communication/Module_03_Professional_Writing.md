## Lesson 4: Writing Clear Messages

### The BLUF Method

**BLUF** = Bottom Line Up Front

Put the most important information first.

```
 UNCLEAR:
"I was working on the project yesterday and found some issues. 
The first one was pretty small, but then I noticed another one... 
[3 paragraphs later]... So I think we need to delay the launch."

 CLEAR (BLUF):
"We need to delay the launch by one week due to critical bugs.

Here are the details:
- Bug 1: Login system fails intermittently
- Bug 2: Payment processing times out

I recommend we address these before going live."
```

### Be Specific

| Vague | Specific |
|----------|-------------|
| "Let's meet soon" | "Can we meet Tuesday at 2 PM?" |
| "It's not working" | "The submit button doesn't respond when clicked" |
| "Send it when you can" | "Please send by Friday, December 27th" |
| "The thing is broken" | "The navigation menu doesn't expand on mobile" |

### One Email, One Topic

Don't combine unrelated topics in one email. Write separate emails for:

- Different projects
- Different requests
- Different decision-makers

| "Kindly do..." | "Please..." (simpler) |
| "Thanking you" | "Thank you" |

### Tone Mistakes
